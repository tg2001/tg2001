## Hi there 👋

### Welcome to my Github Profile

- 🌱 My name is Tuhinangshu Gangopadhyay.
- 🌱 I’m currently in the final year of my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) at Government College Engineering and Leather Technology (GCELT), Kolkata.
- 🔭 I’m interested in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.
- 🤔 So what about my future plans? I want to pursue MS in Computer Science from abroad. This will give me a much better exposure to the outer world, thus providing better experience and future prospects.
